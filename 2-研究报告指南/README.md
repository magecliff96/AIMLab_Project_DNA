2. The Three-Pass Approach
Rather than reading a paper linearly, use three successive passes:

2.1 The First Pass

Takes 5–10 minutes.

Goal: Get a general overview.

Steps: Read the title, abstract, intro, headings, conclusion, and glance at references.

Outcome: Answer the “Five Cs” — Category, Context, Correctness, Contributions, Clarity.

Helps decide whether to read further or skip.

2.2 The Second Pass

Takes up to an hour.

Goal: Understand main content (but not full detail).

Focus: Examine figures, mark unread references, make notes.

Enables you to explain the paper’s core ideas to someone else.

Useful for papers outside your field but still of interest.

2.3 The Third Pass

Takes 1–5 hours.

Goal: In-depth understanding by trying to mentally re-implement the work.

Method: Challenge assumptions, reconstruct logic, compare with your own approach.

Useful for reviewers or if you want to deeply integrate the paper’s ideas.

3. Doing a Literature Survey

Applies the three-pass method to conduct a systematic literature survey:

Start with search engines, read 1-pass of a few relevant papers.

Trace citations and key authors to identify important work.

Explore top conferences to find more papers.

Iterate through 2-pass and 3-pass reads to deepen your understanding and identify missing works.

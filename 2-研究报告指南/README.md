# How to Read a Paper — Summary

This summary is based on *"How to Read a Paper"* by S. Keshav, which introduces an efficient and practical method for reading academic papers using a **three-pass approach**. It also provides guidance for conducting literature surveys.

## 1. The Three-Pass Approach

Instead of reading a paper linearly, use **three structured passes** to understand the content at increasing levels of depth.

### 1.1 First Pass – Quick Overview (5–10 minutes)
- Read the **title**, **abstract**, and **introduction**
- Read **section and subsection headings**
- Read the **conclusion**
- Glance over the **references**

This helps you answer the **Five Cs**:
1. **Category** – Type of paper (e.g., measurement, analysis, prototype)
2. **Context** – Related work and theoretical basis
3. **Correctness** – Are the assumptions valid?
4. **Contributions** – What does the paper offer?
5. **Clarity** – Is it well-written?

Use this pass to decide whether to continue reading.

### 1.2 Second Pass – Understanding the Content (≤ 1 hour)
- Read more carefully, **ignore proofs or fine details**
- Examine **figures and graphs** critically
- **Mark important references** to explore later
- Take notes or annotate

You should now be able to explain the main ideas and evidence to someone else.

### 1.3 Third Pass – Deep Understanding (1–5 hours)
- **Mentally re-implement** the paper
- Question every **assumption and technique**
- Consider how you would present the ideas
- Take note of **limitations**, **missing references**, or **unexplained steps**

You should be able to **reconstruct the paper’s structure**, and assess strengths and weaknesses thoroughly.

## 2. Doing a Literature Survey

To survey literature in a new field:

1. **Search with keywords** on Google Scholar or CiteSeer
2. Perform **first-pass reads** on a few recent papers
3. Check their **related work** sections
4. Identify **shared citations and authors**
5. Explore **top conferences** and browse recent proceedings
6. Make **second and third passes** through key papers
7. Iterate until you have a comprehensive view of the field
